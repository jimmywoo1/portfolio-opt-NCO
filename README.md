# Portfolio Optimization using Nested Clustered Optimization Algorithm
The goal of this project is to use Nested Clustered Optimization algorithm ([Lopez De Prado, 2016](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3469961)) for the portfolio allocation task, and compare the results against allocations obtained from mean-variance optimization using Sharpe ration and minimum variance.

# Results
## Efficient frontier and weight allocations:

## Out-of-sample test with weight allocations:
